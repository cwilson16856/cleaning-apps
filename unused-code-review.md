# Unused Code Review for Cleaning-Tools Project

This document outlines the findings from a thorough codebase review aimed at identifying unused files, libraries, and redundant code within the "cleaning-tools" project.

## Overview

The review covered various components of the project including models, controllers, routes, views, public/js, and utils directories, as well as any standalone files in the root directory. The goal was to compile a comprehensive list of items that are not referenced in any application logic, routes, views, or client-side scripts.

## Findings

### Models

- No unused models identified. All models are actively used in the application logic.

### Controllers

- No unused controllers identified. Each controller has at least one route actively using its functions.

### Routes

- **`routes/itemRoutes.js`**: Appears to be unused. The application does not include functionality for managing individual items within a quote through separate endpoints.

### Views

- **`views/manageServiceItems.ejs`**: This view is not accessible from any part of the application. There's no route rendering this view.

### Public/JS

- **`public/js/dynamicFormBehavior.js`**: The script is referenced in views but doesn't contain any implementation. Consider removing or implementing the required functionality.

### Utils

- **`utils/csrfUtils.js`**: This utility file for CSRF token generation and validation seems to be redundant as the application uses the `csurf` library for CSRF protection.

## Summary

The code review identified a few files and parts of the project that appear to be unused or redundant. Removing these could streamline the project and reduce maintenance overhead. It's recommended to verify the findings with the development team before proceeding with code removal to ensure no functionality is inadvertently affected.
